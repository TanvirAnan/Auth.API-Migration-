I'd be happy to add a diagram to illustrate your architecture! A visual aid will make the structure of your Clean Architecture much clearer for anyone reading your README.md.Here is the revised Markdown, including a text-based visual of the layered structure. You can replace the previous Markdown with this one.🚀 Auth.API – .NET 8 CQRS + MediatR + JWT Authentication SampleThis project is a modern, clean, and scalable authentication service built on .NET 8. It demonstrates best practices, including Clean Architecture, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) using MediatR, and secure JWT Authentication.📌 Overview & Key FeaturesLayered (Clean) Architecture: Structured into distinct layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Auth.API, and BuildingBlocks.CQRS Implementation: Uses MediatR for separating read operations (Queries) from write operations (Commands).PostgreSQL with EF Core: Utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database with automatic EF Core Migrations.JWT Authentication: Stateless, token-based authentication with a global authorization fallback policy.Domain Models: Uses Value Objects (UserId, Email) for robust domain modeling.Validation: Implements request validation using FluentValidation integrated into the CQRS pipeline.Caching: Includes a placeholder for distributed caching (In-memory / Redis).📐 Clean Architecture OverviewThe following diagram illustrates the dependency flow, where the outer layers depend on the inner layers (the arrow v means "depends on"):Shutterstock+--------------------------------+

  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Database": "Host=...;Database=...;Username=...;Password=...",
    "Redis": "localhost:6379"
  },
  "JwtSettings": {
    "Issuer": "Auth.API",
    "Audience": "ClientApp",
    "Key": "SET_IN_USER_SECRETS",
    "ExpiresMinutes": 60
  }
}
⚠️ Important Security Note: The JwtSettings.Key MUST be stored in User Secrets or environment variables in production.🗄️ Database & MigrationsThe project uses EF Core for data access. To manage the database schema:Add MigrationBashdotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate \
  -p Infrastructure/Infrastructure.csproj \
  -s Auth.API/Auth.API.csproj
Update DatabaseBashdotnet ef database update \
  -p Infrastructure/Infrastructure.csproj \
  -s Auth.API/Auth.API.csproj
Note: Automatic migrations are configured to run at application startup for convenience in development.🔐 Authentication FlowRegister User: POST /api/Register (Anonymous)Login: POST /api/LoginReturns: A JSON object containing the user details and the short-lived JWT Access Token.JSON{
  "user": { ... },
  "token": "eyJ..." 
}
Use JWT Token:For protected endpoints, include the token in the request header:Authorization: Bearer <token>
🔑 JWT ClaimsThe token payload includes the following claims:sub — Usernameemailuid — User IDjti — JWT ID (for uniqueness)🧩 Controllers / EndpointsPOST /api/Register (Anonymous)Used to create a new user account.JSON{
  "firstName": "...",
  "lastName": "...",
  "userName": "...",
  "email": "...",
  "password": "..."
}
POST /api/Login (Anonymous)Used to authenticate a user and receive a JWT.JSON{
  "userName": "alice",
  "password": "Alice@2025"
}
PUT /api/UpdateUser (🔒 Requires Authentication)Allows a user to update their own details.The implementation uses the sub claim (username) from the authenticated JWT to enforce a self-update only policy.JSON{
  "firstName": "...",
  "lastName": "...",
  "userName": "...",
  "email": "...",
  "password": "current password" // Required for verification
}
👤 User Entity NoteThe User entity properties include:Id (Value Object UserId, backed by a UUID)FirstName, LastName, UserNameEmail (Value Object with EF conversion)Password⚠️ Important Security Note: The overview mentions the password is "Stored plaintext." This is a critical security vulnerability. The production version MUST implement strong password hashing (e.g., PBKDF2 or Argon2).⚡ CQRS Pipeline BehaviorsThe CQRS pipeline processes commands and queries, implementing cross-cutting concerns:ValidationBehavior: Runs FluentValidation rules before the handler executes.LoggingBehavior: Logs the execution start, end, and duration of the command/query.❗ Error HandlingThe API returns standardized ProblemDetails objects for errors, including a traceId. Common exceptions caught by the global error handler include:NotFoundExceptionBadRequestExceptionValidationException (for validation errors)📘 Using Swagger (OpenAPI)To test secured endpoints:Open the Swagger UI.Click the Authorize button (often a lock icon).Paste your JWT token into the field (⚠️ Do NOT include the Bearer prefix).Call the secured endpoints.
